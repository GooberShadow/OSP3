My code deletes all the shared memory upon completion!!!! wahooooo. its successful!!!
unfortunately, It does not have time in real seconds signal handling. So -t does not function.
and there the real seconds timeout does not work because I could not figure out how to clear things like shared mem and processes correctly with that timeout signal.
Also Do not try and perform -s with anything less than 5 as it will cause things to remain attached and that is a problem to deal with.
Upon any leftover attachments, perform the command ps -e | grep "usrPs" and
ps -e | grep "oss" which will find the numbers you need to kill. then type
kill -9 and after the -9 put the # of the attachment. After doing so execute resetMem.sh
I built a exe called resetMem.sh to clear mem problems. should clear most problems
This is my project. its very close to perfect but not quite due to the signal handling with the real seconds timeout and the shared memory and multiple processes.
However, ctrl-c should work most of the time as I built a signal handler for that
